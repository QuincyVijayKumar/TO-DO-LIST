This Python code creates a simple To-Do List application using the Tkinter library, which provides a graphical user interface (GUI). The application allows users to add, update, delete, and manage tasks, and it also displays the total number of tasks. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the code:

1. Importing Libraries:
tkinter and messagebox: Tkinter is used to create the GUI components, and messagebox is used to display alert and information messages to the user.
2. Functionality Implementation:
	add_task(): This function adds a task to the list. The task is retrieved from the entry widget (task_entry). If the task is not empty, it is added to the listbox (task_listbox), and the entry widget is cleared. If the task is empty, a warning message is shown to the user.
	delete_task(): This function deletes the selected task from the listbox. The function attempts to get the selected task's index using curselection(). If no task is selected, a warning message is displayed.
	clear_all_tasks(): This function clears all tasks from the listbox by deleting all items from the listbox.
	number_tasks(): This function displays the total number of tasks in the listbox using size() to count the tasks and messagebox.showinfo() to display the count.
	update_task(): This function updates the selected task in the listbox. The function retrieves the index of the selected task and the updated task text from the entry widget. If a task is selected and the updated task is not empty, the selected task is replaced with the updated task in the listbox. If no task is selected or the entry is empty, a warning message is shown.
3. Creating the Main Window:
	root = tk.Tk(): Initializes the main application window.
	root.title("To-Do List"): Sets the window title.
	root.geometry("800x600"): Sets the window size.
	root.configure(bg="#d0e8f2"): Configures the background color of the window.
4. Entry Widget for Task Input: task_entry: This entry widget allows the user to input tasks. It is styled with a large font for better readability.
5. Buttons for Task Operations:
	submit_button: Adds the task to the list when clicked, calling add_task().
	delete_button: Deletes the selected task from the list when clicked, calling delete_task().
	clear_button: Deletes all tasks from the list when clicked, calling clear_all_tasks().
	number_button: Displays the total number of tasks when clicked, calling number_tasks().
	update_button: Updates the selected task with a new value when clicked, calling update_task().
6. Listbox to Display Tasks: task_listbox: This listbox widget displays the tasks added by the user. The tasks are displayed in a scrollable list, making it easy to manage multiple tasks.
7. Scrollbar for the Listbox: A scrollbar is added to the listbox to allow the user to scroll through the tasks if the list becomes too long to display in the window.
8. Exit Button: exit_button: Closes the application when clicked, calling root.quit().
9. Layout: The layout is designed to be user-friendly, with the task entry widget at the top, followed by the submit button, the listbox in the middle, and the operation buttons (delete, clear, number of tasks, update) in a grid layout below the listbox.
10. Running the Application: root.mainloop(): This line starts the Tkinter event loop, which keeps the application running and responsive to user input.
11.User Interaction: The user can interact with the application by:
	Entering tasks in the entry widget and adding them to the list.
	Selecting a task from the list to update or delete.
	Viewing the total number of tasks.
	Clearing all tasks at once.
	Exiting the application using the exit button.
